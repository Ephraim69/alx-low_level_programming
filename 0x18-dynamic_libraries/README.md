## 1-create_dynamic_lib.sh
### Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

## 100-operations.so
### Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python. See example for more detail.

## 101-make_me_win.sh
### I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?
    * Our mole got us a copy of the program, you can download it here. Our mole also gave us a piece of documentation:
        * /* Giga Millions program
            * Players may pick six numbers from two separate pools of numbers:
            * - five different numbers from 1 to 75 and
            * - one number from 1 to 15
            * You win the jackpot by matching all six winning numbers in a drawing.
            * Your chances to win the jackpot is 1 in 258,890,850
            *
            * usage: ./gm n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 bonus
        * You canâ€™t modify the program gm itself as Master Sysadmin Sylvain (MSS) always checks its MD5 before running it
        * The system is an Linux Ubuntu 16.04
        * The server has internet access
        * Our mole will be only able to run two commands from a shell script, without being detected by MSS
        * Your shell script should be maximum 3 lines long. You are not allowed to use ;, &&, ||, |, ` (it would be detected by MSS), and have a maximum of two commands
        * Our mole has only the authorization to upload one file on the server. It will be your shell script
        * Our mole will run your shell script this way: mss@gm_server$ . ./101-make_me_win.sh
        * Our mole will run your shell script from the same directory containing the program gm, exactly 98 seconds before MSS runs gm with my numbers: ./gm 9 8 10 24 75 9
        * MSS will use the same terminal and session than our mole
        * Before running the gm program, MSS always check the content of the directory
        * MSS always exit after running the program gm
        * TL;DR; This is what is going to happen
